Asymptotic notation
-------------------

1. Big-O-Notation:
The Big-O notation is used to calculate the time complexity for the worst-case scenario in programming.

2. Big-Omega-Notation
The Big-Omega notation is used to calculate the complexity of the best-case scenario in programming.

3.Big-Theta-Notation
The Theta notation is used to calculate the complexity of the average-case scenario in programming.
